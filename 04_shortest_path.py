Problem 4: Shortest Path Finder (Using Dijkstra's Algorithm)

Given a weighted graph of cities connected by roads, determine the shortest path from a start city to a destination city.

Approach:
- Use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm with a priority queue to find the shortest path from start to destination.
- Maintain distance and previous city mappings to reconstruct the shortest route.
